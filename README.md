# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python - Project II

## Description
In this project, a Python script is used to import data related to bike share systems for 3 major cities in the US including: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Once the data is imported, the script will answer questions related to common measurements of <b>descriptive statistics</b> (average time, count, etc ). The script will also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Software Tools
To complete this project, the following software tools are:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (using the anaconda package)
- A text editor (Sublime, Atom, Notepad, etc)
- A terminal application (Git Bash, Command Prompt, etc)

## The Datasets
The datasets are CSV files provided by Motivate, a bikeshare system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all cities. The data files have six columns:

- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type 

Additionally, the Chicago and New York City files have extra two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

## Answering Questions

- What month occurs most often in the start time?
- What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
- What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
- What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
